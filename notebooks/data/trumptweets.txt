Mini Mike is now negotiating both to get on the Democrat Primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. This is sometimes done, but really not fair! [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 2, 2020 12:17:07 AM
Many of the ads you are watching were paid for by Mini Mike Bloomberg. He is going nowhere, just wasting his money, but he is getting the DNC to rig the election against Crazy Bernie, something they wouldn‚Äôt do for @CoryBooker and others. They are doing it to Bernie again, 2016. [Twitter for iPhone] 
Feb 2, 2020 12:10:56 AM
Mini Mike is part of the Fake News. They are all working together. In fact, Bloomberg isn‚Äôt covering himself (too boring to do), or other Dems. Only Trump. That sounds fair! It‚Äôs all the Fake News Media, and that‚Äôs why nobody believes in them any more. [Twitter for iPhone]

The Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats, don‚Äôt want justice when pushing the Impeachment Hoax, they only want to destabilize the Republican Party so they can do better in the 2020 election, & that includes the House & Senate. They are playing with the people by taking it this far! [Twitter for iPhone]
